Device Name,Connect to Switch Port,Assigned VLAN,Purpose
PC1 (Site 1),SW1 port Fa4/1,VLAN 10 (Data),Test Data VLAN
PC2 (Site 1),SW1 port Fa4/2,VLAN 20 (Voice),Test Inter-VLAN Routing
PC3 (Site 2),SW2 port Fa4/1,VLAN 10 (Data),Test Site-to-Site VPN
PC4 (Site 2),SW2 port Fa4/2,VLAN 20 (Voice),Test VPN + Inter-VLAN



Step 3: Run the Verification Tests (The Demo)
Now, perform these 3 tests to demonstrate every feature of your project.

Test 1: Verify Inter-VLAN Routing (ROAS)
Goal: Prove that different departments (VLANs) at the SAME site can talk to each other.

Action: From PC1, ping PC2.

Bash
ping 192.168.21.10
Why it works: Traffic goes from PC1 -> SW1 -> R1 (via Trunk) -> R1 routes between Sub-interfaces -> SW1 -> PC2.

----------------------------------

Test 2: Verify Internet Access (NAT)
Goal: Prove that private branches can reach the "Public" internet.

Action: From PC1, ping the Core-Router's WAN IP (simulating the internet).

Bash
ping 203.0.113.1
Why it works: R1 translates PC1's private IP (192.168.20.10) to its public WAN IP (203.0.113.2) using NAT. If this fails, the Core Router won't know how to reply to the private IP.

On R1, run:
show ip nat translations

----------------------------------

Test 3: Verify Site-to-Site VPN
Goal: Prove that Site 1 can securely talk to Site 2 over the "public" network.

Action: From PC1 (Site 1), ping PC3 (Site 2).

Bash
ping 192.168.30.10
Why it works:

R1 sees traffic destined for 192.168.30.x.

The Crypto Map ACL matches this traffic.

R1 encrypts the packet and tunnels it to R2.

R2 decrypts it and delivers it to PC3.

Note: The first ping might timeout while the VPN tunnel negotiates.

On R1, run:
show crypto isakmp sa
